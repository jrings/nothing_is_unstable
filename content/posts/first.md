# First

So, after long last I managed to revamp and set up a new homepage. I also intend to write more, at least a bit. 
It's still empty and unfinished, but good enough and maybe good enouygh to stay this way. 

I've struggled with where to go after losing the old web and blogs to social media for a long time. I think
having a central place I own is correct, but the piece I was missing is: It doesn't really matter to
"create content" or make whatever I do persist forever. Not everything we do needs to persist, nobody
is that important. However, I do very much care that sometimes, someone can find my stuff. That there
is a place where it's collected. That's satisfying. And so, there we are.
